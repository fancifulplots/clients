What are your current company goals? What are you hoping to achieve?
Branding vs Direct response advertising

Website

1. absolutely no navigation
2. no hero section 
3. actually the hero section is below the fold (the first "screen-full" of content that appears on the monitor")
4. and the CTA button says "connect iwth us bellow", so you click it and it takes you the same page refreshed... so i'm back up
5. the CTA button could be replaced with the "contact us" form directly, we are you forcing me to scroll and messing with me with the refresh page
6. also the content over all could be improved, there is no social proof (do we have testimonials, any proof, certifications, industry standards etc.) whats their process why should i trust you (EAT principle is Expertiese, Authority on the subject and Trustworthness)
7. Website to link to social media

Branding
Logo to have a light version as well

Instagram
https://www.instagram.com/heritagehorticultural1/
More headlines
Logo to be centered in profile image
Better hashtags
Call to action everywher - every post is an advert
You have amazing video content - we can make reels out of this easily
Amazing that you have photos of your team! - I'd make website material out of that or a collage

Facebook
Could not locate Facebook

Ads
I have not located any ads that are running. 

Targeting clients:
Who is your target audience? 
What is the demographic?

What do they want?


STRONGETS SELLING POINTS:
1. They won't butcher the garden - branding and trustworthiness and social proof
2. I don't have to be bothered with it
